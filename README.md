# dnspy

Find subdomain takeovers.

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/gwen001/dnspy
cd dnspy
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# How does it work

This tool is basically composed of 3 parts:

- grabber
- resolver
- interperter

Each part has a daemon and a queue file. To run a daemon do the following:

```
cd dnspy
./daemon_xxx.py
```

The daemon will run by itself and forever.
Then, as soon as a domain name is entered in the corresponding queue file, the daemon will process it.

The ```daemon_grabber.py``` basically run ```grabber_host.sh``` and feed the resolver queue file.
It's my current bash script to grab subdomains using many external tools.
Feel free to customize it or write your own.  

The ```daemon_resolver.py``` basically run ```massdns``` (so you better have it installed in your system) and feed the interpreter queue file.  

The ```daemon_interpreter.py``` will read the massdns output file and check for subdomains takeover by running ```interpreter.py```.
This script is **strongly** inspired of ```subjack``` but I added some features like the ignore list and also improved the fingerprints with regexp.
Feel free to add your own signatures.  

```
usage: interpreter.py [-h] [-s SOURCE] [-f FINGERPRINTS] [-r] [-v VERBOSE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                        source file (masscan output using format: -o Sqnr)
  -f FINGERPRINTS, --fingerprints FINGERPRINTS
                        fingerprints file
  -r, --reresolve       force reresolve
  -v VERBOSE, --verbose VERBOSE
                        verbose mode, 0:only vulnerable (default), 1:include
                        unknown services and doubt, 2:include ignored and not
                        vulnerable, 3:debug
```

# Output legend

(screenshots after holidays)  

[?] - unknown service  
[YELLOW] - there is something weird (doubt) but mostly not takeoverable  
[GREEN] - possible takeover  
[PINK] - takeover confirmed with an additional check  
[RED] - warning, this service deserve a manual check (like S3 bucket permissions)  

Whatever the color, manual check is always a good idea and should always be performed before sending a report.  

# Recommandations

Use this script on a dedicated server with a good connection.
Use screen or tmux so even if you're disconnected the daemons will still run in the background.

Manually launch the interpreter using ```qinterpreter2.sh``` so the ouput will be nicely displayed and you will be able to customize the fingerprints the way you like.

# Takover cases

1/ subdomain points to a 3rd party service app but the app is not created on the service  
resolution response: most of the time CNAME but sometimes NXDOMAIN  
ex: xxxxxx.azurewebsites.com, xxxx.s3.amazonaws.com, xxxx.herokuapp.com...  

2.1/ subdomain uses 3rd party service but the domain isn't claimed on the service  
resolution response: ?  
ex: cloudfront...

2.2/ subdomain uses 3rd party DNS but the domain isn't claimed on the service  
resolution response: ?  
ex: fastly...  

3/ subdomain points to a 3rd party service but is a A or AAAA record  
resolution response: ipv4 or ipv6  
ex: ?  

4/ subdomain is an alias to a domain which doesn't belong to anyone, buy it!  
resolution response: NXDOMAIN  

# Todo

- http requests to solve case 3/
- screenshots
- find a more appropriate name
- ?
